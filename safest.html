			<p class="name">Volkswagen GTI</p>
			<p>
			Fears that Volkswagen would annihilate the entire Golf lineup are all but forsaken, 
			with the 2022 Golf GTI set to begin an all-new generation of the sporty hatchback. 
			Although it appears the German automaker will still stop selling regular (read: boring) 
			Golfs in the United States, the GTI and the even zestier R model, which we review separately, 
			have been spared. The result is a more powerful GTI with even more desirable features 
			and the same characteristics that helped the outgoing version earn our love and affection.
			The new infotainment, while incredibly convoluted and in dire need of updates, is undoubtedly 
			impressive. With more modern styling inside and out as well as the familiar fantastic-to-drive 
			behavior, the reborn Golf GTI attracts new enthusiasts, continues to reward the faithful, and 
			again makes our 10Best and Editors' Choice lists.

			<p class="name">Porsche 911</p>
			<p>
			With transcendent driving traits and terrific twin-turbo flat-six engines, the 2022 Porsche 
			911 is a nearly flawless sports car. Porsche's iconic two-plus-two-seater is as immersive 
			as it is versatile. Along with the aforementioned flat-six which produces a distinctive snarl 
			and makes between 379 and 473 horsepower the lineup offers a quick-shifting dual-clutch automatic 
			or a manual transmission and rear- or all-wheel drive. The latter ensures its incredible performance 
			can be enjoyed in all four seasons. The 911 comes in coupe, cabriolet (read: convertible), or 
			quasi-convertible Targa body styles. The beauty of the 911 is that its athleticism doesn't diminish 
			its livability. Its ride is surprisingly civil considering its cornering limits and race car-like 
			steering feel. Its interior is roomy up front and can be lavishly appointed.

			<img src = "images/range_rover_velar.jpeg" alt="Range Rover Velar" width="200"/>
			<p class="name">Range Rover Velar</p>
			<p>
			The 2022 Range Rover Velar is Land Rover's style-focused compact SUV, and it also earns its place 
			alongside its luxurious brethren with a high-class ambiance. It's offered with either a turbocharged 
			four-cylinder or a turbocharged-and-supercharged inline-six, but the Velar's chassis lacks the poise 
			and verve we find appealing on rival SUVs such as the BMW X3, the Genesis GV70, or the Porsche Macan. 
			If you're more interested in a comfortable and luxurious cruiser, the Velar is more likely to satisfy, especially if 
			a stylish, high-tech cabin is on your priority list. A widescreen infotainment system is standard, and 
			the Velar's interior design matches the exterior's avant-garde styling. The infotainment system suffers
			from occasional hiccups, though those are expected to be addressed in future system updates.

			<img src = "images/audi_a6.jpeg" alt="Audi A6" width="200"/>
			<p class="name">Audi A6</p>
			<p>
			As luxury sedans go, the 2022 Audi A6 is a smart choice that impresses with its high-tech features, 
			high-quality cabin, and smooth-and-steady ride. These traits help it earn a spot on our Editors' Choice 
			list. A pair of turbocharged engines are on offer here, with 45 models being powered by a four-cylinder 
			and 55 models getting a powerful V-6; all-wheel drive is standard across the lineup. Enthusiast drivers 
			may find the A6's dynamics to be too relaxed, but rivals such as the BMW 5-series and the Mercedes-Benz 
			E-class don't deliver sports-sedan moves either. Instead, the Audi is set up to court modern buyers with 
			its digital dashboard and plentiful driver-assistance features. Its styling presents as expensive and 
			classy but sedate; more extroverted buyers may find the swoopier A7 sedan better satisfies their desire 
			for sleek, sexy style.
