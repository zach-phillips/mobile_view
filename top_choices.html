			<p class="name">Volkswagen GTI</p>
			<p>
			Fears that Volkswagen would annihilate the entire Golf lineup are all but forsaken, 
			with the 2022 Golf GTI set to begin an all-new generation of the sporty hatchback. 
			Although it appears the German automaker will still stop selling regular (read: boring) 
			Golfs in the United States, the GTI and the even zestier R model, which we review separately, 
			have been spared. The result is a more powerful GTI with even more desirable features 
			and the same characteristics that helped the outgoing version earn our love and affection.
			The new infotainment, while incredibly convoluted and in dire need of updates, is undoubtedly 
			impressive. With more modern styling inside and out as well as the familiar fantastic-to-drive 
			behavior, the reborn Golf GTI attracts new enthusiasts, continues to reward the faithful, and 
			again makes our 10Best and Editors' Choice lists.

			<img src = "images/porsche_911.jpeg" alt="Porsche 911" width="200"/>
			<p class="name">Porsche 911</p>
			<p>
			With transcendent driving traits and terrific twin-turbo flat-six engines, the 2022 Porsche 
			911 is a nearly flawless sports car. Porsche's iconic two-plus-two-seater is as immersive 
			as it is versatile. Along with the aforementioned flat-six which produces a distinctive snarl 
			and makes between 379 and 473 horsepower the lineup offers a quick-shifting dual-clutch automatic 
			or a manual transmission and rear- or all-wheel drive. The latter ensures its incredible performance 
			can be enjoyed in all four seasons. The 911 comes in coupe, cabriolet (read: convertible), or 
			quasi-convertible Targa body styles. The beauty of the 911 is that its athleticism doesn't diminish 
			its livability. Its ride is surprisingly civil considering its cornering limits and race car-like 
			steering feel. Its interior is roomy up front and can be lavishly appointed.

			<img src = "images/range_rover_velar.jpeg" alt="Range Rover Velar" width="200"/>
			<p class="name">Range Rover Velar</p>
			<p>
			The 2022 Range Rover Velar is Land Rover's style-focused compact SUV, and it also earns its place 
			alongside its luxurious brethren with a high-class ambiance. It's offered with either a turbocharged 
			four-cylinder or a turbocharged-and-supercharged inline-six, but the Velar's chassis lacks the poise 
			and verve we find appealing on rival SUVs such as the BMW X3, the Genesis GV70, or the Porsche Macan. 
			If you're more interested in a comfortable and luxurious cruiser, the Velar is more likely to satisfy, especially if 
			a stylish, high-tech cabin is on your priority list. A widescreen infotainment system is standard, and 
			the Velar's interior design matches the exterior's avant-garde styling. The infotainment system suffers
			from occasional hiccups, though those are expected to be addressed in future system updates.

			<img src = "images/audi_a6.jpeg" alt="Audi A6" width="200"/>
			<p class="name">Audi A6</p>
			<p>
			As luxury sedans go, the 2022 Audi A6 is a smart choice that impresses with its high-tech features, 
			high-quality cabin, and smooth-and-steady ride. These traits help it earn a spot on our Editors' Choice 
			list. A pair of turbocharged engines are on offer here, with 45 models being powered by a four-cylinder 
			and 55 models getting a powerful V-6; all-wheel drive is standard across the lineup. Enthusiast drivers 
			may find the A6's dynamics to be too relaxed, but rivals such as the BMW 5-series and the Mercedes-Benz 
			E-class don't deliver sports-sedan moves either. Instead, the Audi is set up to court modern buyers with 
			its digital dashboard and plentiful driver-assistance features. Its styling presents as expensive and 
			classy but sedate; more extroverted buyers may find the swoopier A7 sedan better satisfies their desire 
			for sleek, sexy style.

			<img src = "images/rivian_r1t.jpeg" alt="Rivian R1T" width="200"/>
			<p class="name">Rivian R1T</p>
			<p>
			The futuristic R1T is an all-electric pickup truck from new American startup brand Rivian, and it promises 
			300 miles of driving range and lightning-quick acceleration, enough to earn it an Editors' Choice award. 
			At 215.6 inches long, the crew-cab-only R1T splits the difference in size between mid-size pickups such 
			as the Ford Ranger and full-size trucks such as the Ram 1500. The R1T is the first electric pickup truck 
			to make it to production in what seems to be a burgeoning market, soon to include the Ford F-150 Lightning 
			and the GMC Hummer EV SUT. At 3.3 seconds to 60 miles per hour, the R1T is the quickest pickup truck Car and
			Driver has ever tested; it is also the most efficient pickup we have ever tested. That being said, its thoughtful
			mix between utility and luxury is extremely impressive—especially from a new automaker.

			<img src = "images/toyota_4runner.jpeg" alt="Toyota 4Runner" width="200"/>
			<p class="name">Toyota 4Runner</p>
			<p>
			Despite being the elder statesman of the mid-size SUV segment, the 2022 Toyota 4Runner is one of the only 
			ones left that's as rugged as advertised. It may look mostly the same as it did 10 years ago, but its boxed 
			fenders and high beltline still look tough. That image is matched by its sturdy ladder frame and stout V-6 
			engine, which are great for tackling trails, especially with the lineup's various off-road-ready models, 
			but not so great for refinement and fuel economy. The 4Runner's tall and boxy shape contributes to a spacious 
			cabin and cargo area, but the materials inside look and feel cheap. Toyota offsets the popular off-roader's 
			old age with a suite of standard driver assists, including adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist. 
			Still, it's not enough to make the 2022 4Runner as contemporary or desirable as the latest Jeep Wrangler.

        	<img src = "images/jeep_grand_cherokee.jpeg" alt="Jeep Grand Cherokee" width="200"/>
			<p class="name">Jeep Grand Cherokee</p>
			<p>
			When you close your eyes and think of a Jeep, it's likely that the rough-and-tumble Wrangler comes to mind, 
			but the Grand Cherokee is every bit as important to the success of the famed off-road brand in terms of sales. 
			Its appeal is bolstered by the fact that it pairs impressive off-road capability with on-road refinement, 
			offers lots of available luxury appointments and features, and has the rugged, outdoorsy look Jeep buyers 
			love. We like it too, in fact, and gave it an Editors' Choice award. A trio of powertrains are offered, 
			including familiar V-6 and V-8 options and a new plug-in-hybrid variant that Jeep calls 4xe. While rear-wheel 
			drive is standard on models with the V-6, there are no less than three different all-wheel-drive systems available 
			to help tackle whatever your lifestyle requires: from commuting through snowy weather to rock crawling.

			<img src = "images/chevy_camaro.jpeg" alt="Chevrolet Camaro" width="200"/>
			<p class="name">Chevrolet Camaro</p>
			<p>
			The 2022 Chevrolet Camaro coupe and convertible are about the pure and simple joy of driving. Forget about their 
			compromised outward visibility and cramped rear seats. Instead, embrace their lithe handling, satisfying stick-shift 
			transmission, and remarkably smooth ride. A 275-hp turbo four is the default engine, but opting for the 335-hp V-6 
			or the 455-hp V-8 unlocks more melodic soundtracks and punchier acceleration. Its cabin includes some unattractive 
			materials, and some will call it claustrophobic, but its front seats are comfy and supportive, and its well-stocked 
			infotainment system is easy to use. The Ford Mustang and Dodge Challenger are better as daily drivers, but with the 
			optional 1LE package, Chevy's pony car transforms into the best track car of the three. When it comes to performance 
			for the price, it's hard to find a better value.

        	<img src = "images/audi_etron.jpeg" alt="Audi E-Tron" width="200"/>
			<p class="name">Audi E-Tron</p>
			<p>
			The 2022 Audi e-tron has a sci-fi-sounding name that teases its all-electric nature, but otherwise it looks like and 
			acts much like a traditional mid-size luxury SUV. Its coupelike counterpart­­, the e-tron Sportback, has a more interesting 
			appearance but still doesn't command nearly as much attention as the gull-winged Tesla Model X or the jazzy Jaguar I-Pace. 
			While Audi skips the typical EV styling that appeals to the tech crowd, both e-trons boast a sophisticated and tranquil 
			interior, with the fastback Sportback sacrificing some practicality for fashion's sake. A pair of potent electric motors 
			provide all-wheel drive and near-instant acceleration. The 2022 
			e-tron and e-tron Sportback have short range estimates (218 and 222 miles, respectively), but they offset that with notable 
			fast-charging times, provided a capable charging station is nearby.

			<img src = "images/audi_q7.jpeg" alt="Audi Q7" width="200"/>
			<p class="name">Audi Q7</p>
			<p>
			Like the rest of the Audi lineup, the 2022 Q7 SUV combines a handsome design, a technology-rich cabin, and a fun-loving chassis—it 
			just does so with room for the whole family thanks to its standard three rows of seats. The entry-level engine is a 248-hp turbocharged 
			four-cylinder, but those seeking more towing capacity or increased performance should opt for the 335-hp turbocharged V-6; all-wheel 
			drive is standard with both engines. The Q7 can be outfitted with an adjustable air suspension and four-wheel steering for even greater 
			comfort and agility. Off-road performance is impressively capable and composed. Despite all those features, the Q7 isn't quite as 
			sporty as rivals such as the Porsche Cayenne, but it holds its own against the BMW X5, the Mercedes-Benz GLE, and the Volvo XC90.
