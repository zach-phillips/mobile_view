			<img src = "images/ford_f_series.jpeg" alt="Ford F-Series" width="200"/>
			<p class="name">Ford F-Series (1)</p>
			<p>
			Ford's ever-popular pickup truck lineup entered 2021 with a refreshed F-150 lineup that now includes a hybrid and an updated Super Duty model as well. Ford, and the F-150 in particular, has been hit hard by the global microchip shortage, and sales fell 8 percent YOY.
			</p>

		<div>
			<img src = "images/ram_pickup.jpeg" alt="Ram Pickup" width="200"/>
			<p class="name">Ram Pickup (2)</p>
			<p>
			Ram's truck lineup continues its ascent with a strong year that saw sales rise 1 percent. That was enough to beat the Silverado, which typically occupies the second-place sales ranking. Many attribute its rising sales to tame road manners and luxurious interiors.
			</p>
		</div>
        <div>
			<img src = "images/chevrolet_silverado.jpeg" alt="Chevrolet Silverado" width="200"/>
			<p class="name">Chevrolet Silverado (3)</p>
			<p>
			Results for the Silverado were not great in 2021. It was outsold by the Ram truck lineup, and sales declined, with the light-duty model down nearly 13 percent and the HD version down nearly 8 percent. An updated lineup, including a fully-elecric model are imminent.
			</p>
		</div>
        <div>
			<img src = "images/toyota_rav4.jpeg" alt="Toyota RAV4" width="200"/>
			<p class="name">Toyota RAV4 (4)</p>
			<p>
			Ever since it achieved the title of bestselling non-truck in the country, the RAV4 has been extending its lead over its compact-crossover rivals. Sales were down 5 percent compared with last year, mostly due to the ongoing pandemic and supply shortage.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<img src = "images/honda_crv.jpeg" alt="Honda CR-V" width="200"/>
			<p class="name">Honda CR-V (5)</p>
			<p>
			The CR-V is Honda's bread and butter, and its sales are up 9 percent over last year. A hybrid model joined the lineup recently, and we added one to our long-term test fleet. The SUV's ongoing popularity is due to its practical size and solid value-proposition.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<img src = "images/toyota_camry.jpeg" alt="Toyota Camry" width="200"/>
			<p class="name">Toyota Camry (6)</p>
			<p>
			If there's one thing that's certain in the auto sales hierarchy, it's the Camry's place on top of the passenger-car ranks. The mid-size sedan experienced a 7 percent increase over last year, enough to beat out all of the entries on this list that are neither trucks nor SUVs.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
        	<img src = "images/nissan_rogue.jpeg" alt="Nissan Rogue" width="200"/>
			<p class="name">Nissan Rogue (7)</p>
			<p>
			The redesigned 2021 Rogue is far better than its predecessor, and the numbers are reflecting a similar improvement so far this year. Sales were up 25 percent compared with last year in spite of the ongoing pandemic; customers report paying higher prices than ever for Rogue models.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<img src = "images/jeep_grand_cherokee_sales.jpeg" alt="Jeep Grand Cherokee" width="200"/>
			<p class="name">Jeep Grand Cherokee (8)</p>
			<p>
			A new generation of the Grand Cherokee is now on sale, starting with the three-row L model, but the current two-row version is still available. A new two-row model is coming soon, but for now sales were up 26 percent compared with last year. A hybrid model is imminent.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
        	<img src = "images/toyota_highlander.jpeg" alt="Toyota Highlander" width="200"/>
			<p class="name">Toyota Highlander (9)</p>
			<p>
			The Highlander three-row SUV continues its ascent through the sales ranks in 2021 with a strong year. Sales were up 24 percent over last year. The Highlander remains one of the few credible, reliable, hybrid SUVs in the mainstream market.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<img src = "images/honda_civic.jpeg" alt="Honda Civic" width="200"/>
			<p class="name">Honda Civic (10)</p>
			<p>
			The Civic was languishing in the first quarter of the year, but sales have risen since the redesigned 2022 Civic went on sale. Numbers were up 1 percent over last year. An all-new model brought better road manners and an upmarket interior to customers.
